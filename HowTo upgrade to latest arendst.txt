Installation
*********************************

- Get&install PyCham
- clone arendst GIT
- !!! I had to remove GIT from the local version as PyCham seems to see old changes, you will move wrong code

- in GyCham open both repository (so they are indexed) in the same project (it will ask you when opening the 2nd)
- select one of the 2 (I took my local code) and right click and select compare, now search for the arendst code

- now go file by file !!!! ignore those which you do not want this is important
- left side you see markes where are the changes, go there and see what changes

- then on top push the arrow >> to execute the file copy, the in code changes are done immediately.

Test compliation and its done... I was amazed it is 100x times better than with GIT TOOLS

Install MELD & Tortoise Git
**********************************
1) Install Git Gui (needed for Tortoise)
2) install Tortoise
3) install meld
4) changes settings in Tortoise to use Meld
!!!! use this tool for automatic upgrade.... MELD
- add Turtoise in settings/diff viewer/ C:\Program Files (x86)\Meld\meld.exe %mine %base %theirs --output %merged --auto-merge
- you need to add it 3x.... 
- !!! the tool needs some seconds to open.... like 10

Check things with GIT bash
